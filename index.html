<h2>Game of the year 420 Blaze it phaser version</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
It seems as though MLG has made it's way into everything, including my thoughts on how to go at this game.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
In Game of the Year 420 Blaze it Phaser version you play as Swagnemite.  The player should experience the usual absurdity that comes with playing an MLG game.  The player must continue to destroy Shreks in order to find the real Illuminati.  Players should get a good laugh out of playing this game.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Game of the Year 420 Blaze-it phaser version is a mix of the typical top-down shooter as well as a parody game.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Players will be able to move the Swagnemite back and forth attacking Shreks.  Over time the player will eventually reach the end and run into the Iluminati.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
The goal of my prototype is to try out a top down shooter game.  The MLG series has been extremly popular as of late, and I thought it would be a fun idea to try a parody game.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Anyone who is a fan of the chaos that is MLG will get to enjoy the sillyness of Game of the year 420 Blaze-it Phaser edition.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
Game of the year 420 Blaze-it Phaser edition takes place in a strange void near Shrek's swamp.  
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
You are a solider recruited to control the Swagnemite.  As always in an MLG game your goal is to defeat the Illuminati.  Terrible enemies such as Spoderman and shrek may also get in your way. 
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Game of the Year 420 Blaze-it Phaser edition is for adults, and fans of the MLG series.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
Game of the Year 420-Blaze-it Phaser edition should take about 10 minutes to play.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
As with most top down shooters the player must move left and right to hit targets coming at them.</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Most images will be made in microsoft paint or photoshop.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
MLG flappy bird is a good example as well as Game of the Year 420 Blaze-it Get Shreked edition.
