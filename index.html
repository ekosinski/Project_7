<h2>MedExGoneVeryWrong</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Players play this new 2d shooter in which they must stop approaching slimes.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
This prototype has the most new things in it of all my prototypes. It includes many spawned objects as well as more complex hitboxes.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
MedExGoneVeryWrong is very similar to flash games in which the player has a single turret that they must use to shoot everything around them.  The parachute invader from the old ipods is a good example of similar game.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Several green blocks will slowly float towards the player who is at the center of the stage. The player must use his blow dart to shoot all of the blocks out of the sky.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
The goal of this prototype is to test objects entering the screen continuously over time. I also want to make sure all the objects in the stage respond to being hit by certain amounts of objects.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
MedExGoneVeryWrong features the constant fun of shooting down all the approaching objects.  The game keeps running so the thrill continues to go on.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
MedExGoneVeryWrong takes place in a high security testing facility run by the government. 
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
In a remote government facility a lone scientist is running an experiment on some green slime. Before he knows it a failure occurs and the accidic slime starts shooting everywhere.  Fearing for his life the lone scientist must now shoot down as much of the goo as possible before it touches his skin, killing him.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
MedExGoneVeryWrong is for all ages with it's simple gameplay, and colorful objects.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
MedExGoneVeryWrong goes as long as the player desires.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
MedExGoneVeryWrong has no strategies besides to aim at the blocks that are flying directly at the main player.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Most images will be made in microsoft paint or photoshop.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
MedExGoneVeryWrong is similar to the parachute game from the old ipods.
